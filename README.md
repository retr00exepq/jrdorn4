## Introduction

Break It is a JavaScipt block breaker game. Users move a paddle back
and forth across the screen to hit a ball to break bricks while avoiding letting the ball drop.

I drew design inspiration from Atari's arcade game Breakout, and
end3r's [game development workshop](https://github.com/end3r/Gamedev-Canvas-workshop/blob/gh-pages/lesson10.html). Sounds effects are provided by [Juhani Junkala](https://juhanijunkala.com/).
